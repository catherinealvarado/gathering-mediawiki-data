The last voyage of the Karluk, flagship of the Canadian Arctic Expedition of 1913–16, ended with the loss of the ship and the subsequent deaths of nearly half her complement.
On her outward voyage in August 1913, Karluk, a brigantine formerly used as a whaler, became trapped in the Arctic ice while sailing to a rendezvous point at Herschel Island.
After a long drift across the Beaufort and Chukchi seas, the ship was crushed and sunk.
In the ensuing months, the crew and expedition staff struggled to survive, first on the ice and later on the shores of Wrangel Island.
In all, eleven men died before help could reach them.
The Canadian Arctic Expedition was organised under the leadership of Canadian-born anthropologist Vilhjalmur Stefansson, and had both scientific and geographic objectives.
Shortly after Karluk was trapped, Stefansson and a small party left the ship, stating that they intended to hunt for caribou.
As Karluk drifted from her fixed position it became impossible for the hunting party to return to the ship.
Stefansson reached land and then devoted himself to the expedition's other objectives, leaving the crew and staff on board the ship under the charge of its captain, Robert Bartlett.
Conditions on the ice were difficult and dangerous; two parties of four men each were lost in the attempt to reach the island.
After the survivors had landed, Bartlett and an Inuk companion set out across the ice for the Siberian coast, in search of help.
The pair eventually reached Alaska, but sea ice conditions prevented any immediate rescue mission.
On Wrangel Island, the stranded party survived by hunting game, but were short of food and troubled by internal dissent.
Before their rescue in September 1914, three more of the party had died, two of illness and one in violent circumstances.
Historians have divided views on Stefansson's decision to leave the ship.
Some of the voyage's survivors were critical of his seeming indifference to their ordeal and the loss of their comrades.
He escaped official censure, and was publicly honoured for his later work on the expedition despite the Canadian government's reservations about its overall management.
Although Bartlett was criticised by an admiralty commission for taking Karluk into the ice, he was hailed as a hero by the public and by his former Karluk shipmates.
The Canadian Arctic Expedition was the brainchild of Vilhjalmur Stefansson, a US-based, Canadian-born anthropologist of Icelandic extraction who had spent most of the years between 1906 and 1912 studying Inuit life in the remote Arctic Canada.
However, he wanted to extend his plans to include geographical exploration in the Beaufort Sea, then a blank space on the world's maps.
For these expanded aims he needed more money, and approached the Canadian government for assistance.
The Canadian government was concerned that an American-financed expedition would give the United States a legal claim to any new land discovered in the Beaufort Sea, so when the Canadian prime minister Robert Borden met Stefansson in Ottawa in February 1913 he offered to assume financial responsibility for the entire expedition.
Borden's government was hopeful that the expedition would strengthen Canada's claim to sovereignty over the Arctic islands.
The American sponsors agreed to withdraw, subject to an NGS condition that the Society could reclaim its rights to the expedition if Stefansson failed to depart by June 1913.
In a letter to the Canadian Victoria Daily Times, Stefansson set out these separate aims.
The expedition also aimed to be the most comprehensive scientific study of the Arctic ever attempted.
While a Northern Party searched for new lands, a mainly land-based Southern Party under zoologist Rudolph Anderson would carry out surveys and anthropological studies in the islands off the northern Canadian coast.
The Northern Party's ship, Karluk, would proceed north from the Canadian coast until it either found land or was stopped by ice.
It would explore any land it encountered; otherwise it would follow the ice edge eastward and attempt to winter at either Banks Island or Prince Patrick Island.
If the ship was trapped in the ice and forced to drift, the party would study the direction of Arctic currents and carry out oceanographic research.
Stefansson's plan was to take the expedition to the old whaling station at Herschel Island off the Canadian Arctic coast, where the final composition of the Northern and Southern Parties would be decided and where equipment and supplies would be divided among the different strands of the venture.
The haste to meet the NGS deadline led to concerns among the expedition's members about the adequacy of the provision of food, clothing and equipment.
There were disputes between Stefansson and the scientists over the chain of command; the Canadian Geological Survey, which had provided four scientists to the expedition, wanted these men to report to them rather than to Stefansson.
Southern Party leader Rudolph Anderson threatened to resign over Stefansson's claim to the publication rights of all private expedition journals.
The scientific team, made up of some of the most distinguished men in their fields, included representatives from the United States, Denmark, Norway and France, as well as from Britain and its Empire.
Only two, however, had previous polar experience: Alistair Forbes Mackay, the expedition's medical officer, had visited Antarctica with Sir Ernest Shackleton's Nimrod expedition in 1907–09, and had been one of the party of three to discover the location of the South Magnetic Pole.
Another Nimrod veteran, the 46-year-old James Murray, was Stefansson's oceanographer.
Stefansson had wanted American whaling skipper Christian Theodore Pedersen to captain Karluk, the ship designated for the Northern Party.
When Pedersen withdrew, the captaincy was offered to 36-year-old Newfoundland-born Robert Bartlett, an experienced polar navigator who had commanded Robert Peary's ship on the latter's 1909 polar expedition.
Bartlett did not have time, however, to select Karluk's crew, which was hurriedly assembled from around the Royal Navy Dockyard at Esquimalt in British Columbia.
McKinlay worried that this crew might lack the qualities and character necessary in the arduous months ahead, concerns shared by Bartlett, whose first act on arrival in Esquimalt was to fire the first officer for incompetence.
Anderson.
Karluk had been chosen by Pedersen and bought by Stefansson for the bargain price of US$10,000.
Despite 14 arctic whaling voyages, including six overwinterings, she had not been built to withstand sustained ice pressure, and lacked the engine power to force a passage through the ice.
She did not match the expectations of Bartlett, or of many of the more experienced crew.
The ship spent most of April and May 1913 undergoing repairs and refitting at the dockyard in Esquimalt.
When Bartlett arrived in early June he immediately ordered further repair work.
In addition to Karluk, Stefansson had purchased sight unseen a small gasoline-driven schooner, Alaska, to act as a supply ship for the Southern Party.
He later added a second schooner, Mary Sachs, when the hold space in Alaska proved inadequate.
In the confusion surrounding the expedition's departure, McKinlay notes, no attempt was made to align men or equipment to their appropriate ships.
Thus anthropologists Henri Beuchat and Diamond Jenness, both designated for the Southern Party, found themselves sailing with Karluk, while their equipment was on board Alaska.
McKinlay himself, aboard Karluk as magnetic observer, discovered that most of his equipment was with Alaska.
Karluk left Esquimalt on 17 June 1913, sailing north towards Alaska.
The immediate destination was Nome, on the coast of the Bering Sea.
There was trouble from the beginning with the steering gear and with the engines, both of which needed frequent attention.
On 2 July Karluk reached the Bering Sea in mist, fog and rapidly falling temperatures; six days later she arrived at Nome where she joined Alaska and Mary Sachs.
While the ships were being loaded in Nome, some of the scientists pressed for a meeting with the leader to clarify plans, particularly with regard to the Northern Party whose schedule was vague.
The meeting was unsatisfactory.
Stefansson's attitude offended several of the men, some of whom threatened to leave the expedition.
They had read press reports in which Stefansson had apparently said that he expected Karluk to be crushed, and that the lives of the staff were secondary to the scientific work.
Stefansson would not explain these matters, nor give further details of his plans for the Northern Party.
Despite the scientists' alarm and dissatisfaction, none resigned.
At Port Clarence, just north of Nome, 28 dogs were taken on board before Karluk sailed north on 27 July.
The next day she crossed the Arctic Circle, and almost immediately encountered rough weather which resulted in flooded cabins and seasickness.
On 1 August the permanent Arctic ice pack was seen; Bartlett made several attempts to breach the ice, but each time was forced back.
Meanwhile, Stefansson had left to travel over the ice to Point Barrow.
He rejoined the ship at Cape Smythe on 6 August, bringing with him Jack Hadley, a veteran trapper who required passage east.
Hadley, a long-time acquaintance of Stefansson's, was entered in the ship's books as carpenter.
At Cape Smythe two more Inuit hunters, Keraluk and Kataktovik, joined the expedition, together with Keraluk's family—wife Keruk and their two young daughters Helen and Mugpi.
As the voyage proceeded, Bartlett became increasingly anxious about the extent of ice in the area, and noted that the brass stemplates on the ship's bow had already been damaged.
Over the next few days Karluk struggled to make headway, as Bartlett took the ship northwards away from the coast, following channels of open water.
The only scientific tasks of substance that could be carried out during this period were Murray's dredging operations, through which he collected many species of Arctic sea life, and the regular depth soundings.
Shortly afterwards, Stefansson informed Bartlett that all hopes for further progress that year had ended, and that Karluk would have to winter in the ice.
On 19 September, with Karluk ice-bound and largely stationary, Stefansson announced that in view of the shortage of fresh meat and the likelihood of a long sojourn in the ice, he would lead a small hunting party that would search for caribou and other game in the area of the Colville River.
The next day the six men departed.
In an unpublished journal and later correspondence, McKinlay suggested that Stefansson's departure amounted to abandoning the ship to its fate.
The anthropologist Gísli Pálsson, writing of the expedition, asserts that while the anger of Bartlett and the crew is understandable, there is no evidence that Stefansson deliberately abandoned the men.
It is arguable, Pálsson says, that Stefansson acted responsibly in attempting to secure a supply of fresh meat which would counter the possibility of scurvy, should Karluk be trapped in the ice for a long time.
There were fears among some that Karluk would repeat the experience of the Jeannette, an American vessel that 30 years previously had drifted in the Arctic ice for months before sinking, with the subsequent loss of most of her crew.
Bartlett became aware that Murray and McKay, the two veterans of Shackleton's Nimrod expedition, were openly contemptuous of their captain's leadership.
They were making plans to leave the ship at an appropriate time, and head for land on their own.
As the weather grew worse Bartlett ordered supplies and equipment to be transferred on to the ice, both to lighten the ship and as a precaution should it be necessary to abandon the vessel in a hurry.
Food supplies were augmented by seal hunts—two or three seals a day was the average bag, according to McKinlay—and by a single polar bear that had wandered near the ship in mid-November.
On 15 November Karluk reached 73°N, the most northerly point of its drift, and then began moving south-west, in the general direction of the Siberian coast.
Despite the bleak outlook—Bartlett was privately convinced that Karluk would not survive the winter— a determined effort was made to celebrate Christmas, with decorations, presents, a programme of sports on the ice, and a banquet.
The sighting of land briefly raised morale, but in the New Year the ice began breaking up and forming pressure ridges.
Bartlett, still hoping to save his ship, gave orders to lighten her by removing all accumulated snow from the decks.
He also ordered all hands to have warm clothing ready.
There was no possibility that the pumps could deal with the inflow, and the captain gave the order to abandon ship.
Weather conditions, says McKinlay, could hardly have been worse, but the crew and staff worked throughout the night, in pitch darkness and driving snow, to add to the quantities of rations and equipment already stashed on the ice.
Bartlett remained on board until the last moments, playing loud music on the ship's Victrola.
At 3:15 p.m. on 11 January, Bartlett put on Chopin's Funeral March as a final salute to the ship, and stepped off.
Karluk sank within minutes, her yardarms snapping off as she disappeared through the narrow hole in the ice.
McKinlay took stock of the stranded party: 22 men, one woman, two children, 16 dogs and a cat.
Two shelters had been built, one a snow igloo with a canvas roof, the other constructed from packing cases.
To the latter was added a kitchen with a large stove rescued from Karluk's engine room.
A small, separate shelter was built for the five Inuit, and a rough perimeter created from coal bags and assorted containers.
Stores were plentiful, and the party was able to eat well.
Much of the time in the first days of the camp was spent preparing and adjusting clothing and sleeping gear, in readiness for the forthcoming march to Wrangel Island.
The ice drift was slowly moving the camp in the direction of the island, but as yet there was insufficient daylight to attempt the march.
Amid this activity Mackay and Murray, now joined by the anthropologist Henri Beuchat, played little part in the general life of the camp and expressed their determination to leave it, independently, as soon as possible.
Bartlett wanted to wait for the longer daylight hours of February before attempting the march, but was persuaded by McKinlay and Mamen to send a trailbreaking group to set up an advance camp on Wrangel Island.
A party of four, led by Karluk's first officer Alexander Anderson and including crew members Charles Barker, John Brady and Edmund Golightly, left Shipwreck Camp on 21 January with instructions from Bartlett to establish their camp at or near Berry Point on the north shore of Wrangel Island.
This was the last sighting of Anderson's party; their ultimate fate was not established until ten years later, when their remains were found on Herald Island.
Bartlett decided to send a team back to establish the exact location of the island that the Anderson party had approached, and to determine if Anderson had actually landed there.
An injury to his knee ruled Mamen out from this mission, which was undertaken by ship's steward Ernest Chafe, with the Inuit pair, Kataktovik and Kuraluk.
A careful examination through binoculars revealed no signs of the missing party, and Chafe concluded that Anderson and company had not reached the island.
Chafe and his party then returned to Shipwreck Camp.
The letter requested appropriate supplies, and concluded by emphasising that the journey was on their own initiative and absolving Bartlett from all responsibilities.
Bartlett allocated them a sledge, a tent, six gallons of oil, a rifle and ammunition and food for 50 days.
They left on 5 February; the last sighting of them was a few days later, by Chafe and the Inuit, returning from their abortive trip to Herald Island.
They found Mackay's party struggling to make headway, with some of their provisions lost and clothing and other equipment discarded to lighten their load.
Beuchat in particular was in a distressed state, nearly delirious and in the throes of hypothermia.
However, the party refused assistance and rejected Chafe's pleas that they return with him to Shipwreck Camp.
Thereafter the only hint of their fate was a sailor's scarf belonging to Morris, later found buried in an ice floe.
It was assumed that the four had either been crushed by the ice, or had fallen through it.
Hadley, nearing 60 years of age, was one of the few, along with Bartlett and the Inuit, with experience of travelling for distances over ice.
Bartlett sent his forces out, in groups, to blaze a trail and lay down supply depots on the route to Wrangel Island, thus preparing his inexperienced party for the hazards of ice travel.
When he felt they were ready for the main journey he divided them into four teams and sent the first two away on 19 February.
Bartlett himself led the last two groups from the camp on 24 February, leaving a note of the party's location in a copper drum in case the camp should drift into an inhabited area.
The ice surface was very broken up, making travel slow and difficult.
At first the parties were able to travel along a track that had been marked out by the advance parties.
However, recent storms had destroyed much of the trail, and in places progress was held up by breaking ice which at one point almost wrecked Bartlett's camp as his team slept.
These stretched east and west, blocking any route to the island.
McKinlay, Hadley and Chafe were sent on a risky journey back to Shipwreck Camp to pick up supplies that had been left there, while the rest slowly chopped and cut a pathway through the towering ridges.
Hadley claimed that the ridges were worse than anything he had seen in his long years of Arctic experience.
The later stages of the journey were easier, as the group travelled over steadily smoother ice, and on 12 March they reached land, a long spit of sand stretching out from the northern shores of Wrangel Island.
Bartlett's initial plan had been for the group to rest briefly on Wrangel Island and then to move on together to the Siberian coast.
However, because three men—Mamen, Malloch and Maurer—were injured, and others were weak and frostbitten, Bartlett decided that the main party should remain on the island while he went for help taking only Kataktovik.
After finding nothing, they headed across the ice towards Siberia, but progress was slow over a surface that was frequently shifting and breaking up to form leads of open water.
More time was lost digging out their provisions from the steadily drifting snow.
As they drew nearer to the mainland, Kataktovik became nervous; he had heard that the Alaskan Inuit were disliked in Siberia by the native Chukchi people, and feared for his life.
Bartlett did his best to reassure him as they moved slowly forward.
On 4 April the pair reached land near Cape Jakan, west of Cape North on the northern Siberian coast.
The presence of sledge marks in the snow showed they had landed in an inhabited area.
They followed these tracks for a day, before arriving at a small Chukchi village.
Here, contrary to Kataktovik's fears, they were received hospitably, and given shelter and food.
On 7 April they set out for East Cape and the villages on the Bering coast.
Bartlett had not previously experienced such relentlessly cold weather, with blizzards, hurricane-force winds, and temperatures often below −50 °C (−58 °F).
On the way they passed through other Chukchi villages, where Bartlett traded goods for necessary supplies—he exchanged his Colt revolver for a young, strong dog.
On 24 April they arrived at Emma Town, a settlement a few miles west of East Cape.
At Emma Town Bartlett met Baron Kleist, a distinguished Russian official who offered to take him to Emma Harbour on the coast, a week's journey away, where he could look for a ship to Alaska.
On the way they learned that Captain Pedersen was in the area.
On 16 May they reached Emma Harbour; five days later Pedersen arrived in the whaler Herman and, without delay, took Bartlett on board and set out for Alaska.
They arrived off Nome on 24 May, but ice prevented them reaching the shore.
After three days' waiting they turned south, and landed at St Michael, where Bartlett was at last able to send a radio message to Ottawa informing the government of Karluk's fate.
He also made enquiries about the whereabouts of the United States revenue cutter Bear, which he saw as a possible rescue vessel for the stranded party.
Before his departure, Bartlett asked the party to set up several camps around the island, which would increase the hunting areas.
The captain also felt that separation into smaller groups would assist general harmony by keeping incompatible characters apart.
He wanted all groups to reassemble at Rodgers Harbor, on the south side of the island, about the middle of July.
However, dissension broke out almost immediately after Bartlett's departure over the sharing of food.
There was little prospect of augmenting supplies by hunting birds and game until the weather improved in May or June.
When Hadley and the Inuit, Kuraluk, returned from a seal hunt on the ice, Hadley was widely suspected of concealing the proceeds of the hunt for his own consumption; the same pair were also accused of wasting scarce cooking oil.
Chafe, whose feet had become gangrenous after severe frostbite, had his toes removed by second engineer Williamson, with improvised tools.
McKinlay and Munro risked their lives by travelling over the sea ice towards Herald Island, in a final effort to locate either of the missing parties.
Other health problems persisted; Malloch's frostbitten feet failed to heal, and Mamen's knee, which he had dislocated during the days at Shipwreck Camp, troubled him continuously.
A worrying illness began to affect many of the party, the general symptoms were swelling of the legs, ankles and other body parts, accompanied by acute lethargy.
Mamen himself died ten days later of the same debilitating disease.
From early June the diet was augmented with the appearance of birds.
These birds and their eggs became a vital source of food; as the supply of seal meat dwindled to nothing, the party was reduced to eating rotten flippers, hide, or any part of a seal that was remotely edible.
Breddy was suspected of other thefts.
On 25 June, after a gunshot was heard, Breddy was found dead in his tent.
Various items stolen from McKinlay were found among Breddy's personal effects.
Despite the sombre outlook, the Canadian flag was raised at Rodgers Harbor on 1 July in honour of Dominion Day.
As August came without sign of a ship and the weather began to turn wintry again, hopes of rescue fell; the party began to prepare for another winter.
The revenue cutter Bear arrived in St Michael, Alaska, midway through June.
Her master, Captain Cochran, agreed to go to Wrangel Island as soon as he got permission from the United States government.
It would be impossible, in any event, to attempt the rescue before mid-July; ice conditions in the Arctic that year were reported as severe.
After receiving permission, Bear, with Bartlett aboard, left St Michael on 13 July; the ship had many calls to make along the Alaskan coast before she could proceed with the rescue.
On 5 August, at Port Hope, Bartlett met with Kataktovik and gave him his expedition wages and a new suit of clothing.
At Point Barrow on 21 August Bartlett encountered Burt McConnell, Stefansson's erstwhile secretary, who gave details of Stefansson's movements after leaving Karluk the previous September.
In April 1914, McConnell reported, Stefansson had headed north with two companions, searching for new lands.
McConnell left Point Barrow for Nome aboard King and Winge, an American-registered walrus hunter, while Bear finally sailed for Wrangel Island.
Back in Nome Bartlett met Olaf Swenson, who had chartered King and Winge for the season and was about to sail for Siberia.
Bartlett requested that, if possible, King and Winge stop by Wrangel Island and look for the stranded Karluk party.
Bear left Nome on 4 September, a few days after Swenson's ship.
King and Winge, with McConnell still aboard, reached Wrangel Island on 7 September.
That morning the group at Rodgers Harbor were awakened early in the morning by the sound of a ship's whistle, and found King and Winge lying a quarter of a mile offshore.
They were rapidly transferred to the ship, which then picked up the remainder of the stranded party who were camped along the coast at Cape Waring.
By the afternoon all 14 survivors were aboard.
After a futile attempt to approach Herald Island, the ship began the journey back to Alaska; next day she encountered Bear, with Bartlett aboard.
McConnell records that the party were unanimous in their desire to remain with the ship that had effected their rescue, but Bartlett ordered them aboard Bear.
The reunited party arrived at Nome on 13 September, to a great welcome from the local population.
However, he was later censured by an admiralty commission for taking Karluk into the ice, and for allowing Mackay's party to leave the main group—despite the letter that Mackay and the others had signed, absolving the captain from responsibility.
Stefansson, too, was privately critical of Bartlett's conduct.
Bartlett resumed his career at sea, and over the next 30 years led many more excursions to the Arctic.
During the Second World War he carried out surveying and supply work for the Allies; he died, aged 70, in April 1946.
His account of the Karluk disaster, published in 1916, makes no direct criticism of Stefansson or anyone else; Niven records, however, that to his friends Bartlett was highly uncomplimentary about his former leader.
In 1918 Stefansson returned after four years' absence, reporting the discovery of three new islands.
He was honoured by the National Geographical Society, received tributes from polar veterans such as Peary and Adolphus Greely, and was given the presidency of the Explorers Club of New York.
In Canada his reception was more muted; there were questions relating to the overall costs of the expedition, its poor initial organisation, and his handling of the Southern Party which, under Rudolph Anderson, completed its work independently of Stefansson.
Anderson and other members of the Southern Party later petitioned the Canadian government to investigate statements made by Stefansson in his 1921 book The Friendly Arctic, which they felt reflected poorly on their honour.
Stefansson, who never returned to the Arctic, died in 1962 at the age of 82.
The fate of First Officer Alexander Anderson's party remained unknown until 1924, when an American vessel landed at Herald Island and found human remains, with supplies of food, clothing, ammunition and equipment.
From these artefacts it was established that this was Anderson's party.
No cause of death was established, though the plentiful unconsumed supplies ruled out starvation.
One theory was that the tent had blown away in a storm and that the party had frozen to death.
Another was carbon monoxide poisoning within the tent.
The mystery illness which affected most of the Wrangel Island party and accelerated the deaths of Malloch and Mamen was later diagnosed as a form of nephritis brought about by eating faulty pemmican.
Of the survivors, Hadley continued working for the Canadian Arctic Expedition, becoming second officer and later master of the supply ship Polar Bear.
He died of influenza, in San Francisco in 1918.
Hadley and McConnell wrote accounts of their experiences for Stefansson, who incorporated them in The Friendly Arctic.
Chafe also wrote and published a short account.
Most of the others quickly returned to relative obscurity, but in 1922 Fred Maurer was persuaded by Stefansson to join an attempt to colonise Wrangel Island.
To the embarrassment of the Canadian government, Stefansson insisted on going ahead, even though Wrangel Island was indisputably part of what had then become the Soviet Union.
A party of five, including Maurer, was sent to the island; only one, an Inuit woman Ada Blackjack, survived.
Despite their ordeal, many of the Karluk survivors lived long lives; Williamson, who declined to speak or write of his experiences in the Arctic, lived to be 97, dying in Victoria, Canada, in 1975.
McKinlay died in 1983, aged 95, having published his account of the expedition in 1976.
Kuraluk, Kuruk and their daughters, Helen and Mugpi, returned to their former life at Point Barrow.
Mugpi, who later was known as Ruth Makpii Ipalook, became the very last survivor of the Karluk voyage, dying in 2008 after a full life, aged 97.
Six first-hand accounts of Karluk's last voyage have been published.
These include Stefansson's account which only covers the June to September 1913 period.
Expedition secretary Burt McConnell wrote an account of the Wrangel Island rescue which was published in The New York Times, 15 September 1914.
A version of McConnell's account appears in Stefansson's book.
