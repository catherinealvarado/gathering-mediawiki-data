# WikipediaSentences
Sentences scraped from Wikipedia featured ariticle list.

If you would like to pull data from different articles in Wikipedia then edit the validWiki.txt file. Delete all of the article titles, if you do not want to pull data from those articles, and write the titles of the articles you are interested in.

Run the code in gatherWikiData.js and you will get a textfile called allWikipediaSentences.txt with all of the content from the articles you were interested in.
